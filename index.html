    <h2> <span>Digital Magazines Versus Online Magazines</span> </h2>
    <p>
      First of all, there are plenty of terms flying around (digital magazine,
      online magazine, ezine, webzine, digital edition, digital publication,
      magazine apps, etc.). It can be tricky at first to get past all the lingo,
      so let’s start by clearing it up.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a Digital Magazine?</h3>

    <p>
      Simply put, a digital magazine has many of the same characteristics as a
      print magazine, but uses <span class="bold underline">D</span>igital <span class="bold underline">P</span>ublishing <span class="bold underline">T</span>echnology (DTS) so it can be
      consumed on an electronic device like a computer, tablet, or mobile phone.
      Here are the advantages to using a digital magazine. 
    <ol>

     <li> <strong>Easy access to content:</strong> Digital publications make it simpler for us to save our favorite articles, share them, make a community, and discuss online.</li>
     <li> <strong>It can be accessed and read anytime, anywhere:</strong>  During travel, lunch-break, or while waiting at a coffee shop. Rather than handling a heap of books, one can access information, instantaneously on his fingertips.
      </li>
     <li> <strong>Portable and Convenient:</strong> With digital magazines, a reader can carry multiple issues together instead of carrying multiple printed magazines.</li>
     <li> <strong>Global Presence:</strong> Once published, a digital magazine will be globally available. An author can reach a worldwide audience to share his story and thoughts. Geographical borders are thus no more a barrier.</li>
     <li> <strong>Interactivity:</strong> Being more interactive than printed versions, digital magazines provide a better user experience. In addition to adding highly engaging images, audio, and video, one can pique users’ interest by showcasing enthralling 360-degree views, pop-ups, weblinks, and many other interactive element</li>
       
    </ol>
   
    </p>
    <h3>What is an Online Magazine?</h3>
    <p>
      Online magazines (or ezines, e-zines, eMagazines, webzines) are digital
      magazines that are hosted, distributed, and read online. While they share
      some characteristics with online newspapers and blogs, the editorial
      approach remains more like a traditional magazine. Due to their low cost
      compared to print, online magazines can be seen as a disruptive
      technology. Many magazine publishers have either created online editions
      of their magazines (referred to as a digital edition), or switched
      exclusively to digital formats. The relative ease of producing digital
      online magazines has also opened up the digital publishing space, allowing
      virtually anyone to: <ul>
        <li> Create</li> <li>Publish, </li> <li>Distribute their online magazines and,</li> <li>Achieve a wide readership</li></ul>.
